    <h2>27. Remove Element</h2>
    <p>
      Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of
      val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then
      return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
    </p>
    <br>
      Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k,
      to get accepted, you need to do the following things: </br>
      Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
